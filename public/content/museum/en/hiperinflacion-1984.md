Between 1982 and 1985, Bolivia suffered a devastating inflationary process. The average exchange rate rose from 144 Bolivian pesos per US dollar in 1982, to 718,000 Bolivian pesos per dollar in August 1985. Hyperinflation began in April 1984 until August 1985. Scarcity, hopelessness, long queues to acquire a few products for subsistence, speculation, patrimonial losses in Bolivian families, protests, and consequently long and hard social conflicts were the common denominator of those days.

If you want as a souvenir a banknote from the beginning of this period in Bolivia's history, request it free of charge at reception.
