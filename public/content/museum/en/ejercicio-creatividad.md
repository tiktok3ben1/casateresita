If you take a stone and observe it from different angles, you can imagine different figures that you can depict with some color. A hare, a fish, a bird, a manta ray… When sculpting marble, Michelangelo, the master of the Italian Renaissance said: "every block of stone has a statue inside it, and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it."
