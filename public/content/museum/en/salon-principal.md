The main hall of the house, preserves two grand pianos. The first one is a Steinway & Sons Piano (New York) and the other a Gaveau (Paris). Both pianos were manufactured at the beginning of the past century, so the piano keys were manufactured at that time with ebony and ivory (actually these materials are not used anymore for obvious reasons). These beautiful instruments are in a perfect state of conservation and have a wonderful sound.

The original French furniture, Luis XV style, was brought from Lima.

The fine decoration includes among other things, mirrors, ornaments and small paintings. Among them there are some that stand out; like a drawing from the recognized bolivian artist Cecilio Guzmán de Rojas, a drawing from Ricardo Perez Alcalá, a very well-known aquarellist, a painting from the XVII century in oil of the artist Leonardo Flores, a painting of "Madonna with child" of unknown authorship.

Among other curiosities we can find a musical box with the Fuji Mountain (Japan), a peacock feather duster, a Chinese jar, or the onyx chess board.

The German Radio Telefunken (1950) was a distinguished brand in the society of La Paz of that time.
Teresita included with love through the years, many pictures of the family that are also displayed on the main room too.
