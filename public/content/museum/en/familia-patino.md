Simón I. Patiño, the Tin King, his wife Albina (Teresita's great-aunt) and their children Rene, Antenor, Graziella, Elena and Luz Mila.

At his death, in 1947, Simón I. Patiño was one of the richest men in the world. Dynamic mining entrepreneur, of humble origin, controversial, praised by many and criticized by others, he was undoubtedly the most prominent Bolivian personality internationally in the first half of the twentieth century.
