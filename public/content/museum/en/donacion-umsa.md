# School Of Medicine (UMSA)

In 1937, Don José María Gamarra donate his property of Miraflores to the University Mayor de San Andres for the construction of the faculty of Medicine and others related. Many years later his son Juan (Teresita’s husband) graduated from this school and continued his studies in United States of America.


As Juan became a very well-known surgeon and teacher of the medical School in La Paz, Don José María considered that his son Juan was the one to preserve the parchment of thanks from the University, so now we have it on display here.


We suggest to read this nice story about Dr Juan Gamarra and his father Don José María written by Mauricio Aira.

## Paralel History Of Silver And Coca Leave, But Also Of Coca Leave And Gold. by Mauricio Aira

An article from Humberto Vacaflor describes in a poetical way the old rivalry between the silver and coca leave, this brought to my mind a pleasant memory of the so called “Coca King”, José María Gamarra, father from the medical doctor Juan Gamarra who operated my feet after being born with a malformation.


After been Operated at “Clinica Americana de Obrajes” I established a relationship with Don José María because we shared the same room. He was recovering from a minor surgery, and during this time he patiently told me the reason of his honorable tittle of “El Rey de la Coca” (Coca King).  Showing me a shining necklace made with golden nuggets of different sizes, he put his eye in one in particular “this is the nugget” he said, “the  biggest one”, (it has three centimeter long and 1 centimeter wide), “that was found in  Los Yungas”, “it was found at the feet of the Huayna Potosi”, part of the Andes Mountain range where gold is born in a selfish way and runs through the waters , little by little.


A sincere friendship arose, and from me a great admiration for his work example and all the effort he made through his life. I remember he said “Nowadays there is not any “cocani” (Coca leave seller) who doesn’t sell my product, it’s everywhere”
We are talking of the year 1957, long away from the cocaine boom that started in Bolivia during Banzer Government in 1975. In that time coca leaves were used in 98% for “acullico” (personal consumption) and coca from La Paz was the most noted one.
In fact, Humberto, the parallelism of coca and silver is historic, mysterious, endearing, as it is with gold.


Cleary you run into producers of Yungas who found gold nuggets in some occasions. And in this moment the natural, spontaneous alliance occurred.


Don José María invited me to his house, saying “when you arrive to Plaza del Estudiante you will see the Sucre monument, my house is located where his sword points” I arrived to the house and once there he told me curious histories about coca leave that I will keep for another moment.


I wanted also to give thanks to Juan Gamarra, (I never had the opportunity) Thanks to his work I was able to walk straight, he was the one who took the initiative and did it for free, correcting the abnormality with the reduction of the calcaneus.
Also thanks to his father, the “Coca King” Don José María Gamarra, since I was able to hear from him the first histories of Coca leave.
