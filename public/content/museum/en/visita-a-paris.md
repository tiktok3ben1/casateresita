Paris was the beloved city of Teresita, and she had the opportunity to visit it in many occasions. In the picture, we can see Teresita accompanied with her husband (her boyfriend at that time), her mother, her sister and a couple of friends at Lido, the famous cabaret in the "Avenue du Champs Elisee".
