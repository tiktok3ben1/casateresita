Between 1932 and 1935 Bolivia and Paraguay staged the bloodiest war of the past century in Southamerica, that took the lives of more than 90.000 people from both countries.

Bothe countries didn't have clear limits in the area, and as the Chaco Boreal was a far remoted place from the urban centers of Bolivia and its capital, the distribution of supplies and armament was a very difficult task that ended in several defeats for Bolivia in the military field. This situation eventually led to several defeats in the battlefield, and also the exhaustion of the civilian population.

Despite the great efforts of the Bolivian army to regain positions, The 12th of June of 1935 the cessation of hostilities was signed.

On the 21st of July of 1938, Bolivia resigned to Paraguay 70% of the disputed territory. However, years after the biggest natural gas deposits in the zone were found in Bolivian Territory, and now a days natural gas is the main income of our country.
