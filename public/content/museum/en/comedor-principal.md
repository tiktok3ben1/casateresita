The dining room guards in its cabinets a beautiful collection of gold-plated cups, Chinese tableware, silversmith from Peru, Murano crystal cups (Italy) and Bohemian crystal glassware.

Among other curiosities we can find a Japanese wooden tea set, a Chinese figure carved in Ivory for example.

The walls are decorated with some paintings; for example there is a beautiful painting of the European school of the XIX century (Author: F.PIRKNER), two decorative paintings from Japan, (these were a gift from the medical doctors who contributed with the bolivian Japanese "Instituto de Gastroenterología" in La Paz.

In this room we can appreciate also some handwritten documents of the Spanish crown dated from 1682 and 1683.

Please take a look of the beautiful lamp that embellish the room.
