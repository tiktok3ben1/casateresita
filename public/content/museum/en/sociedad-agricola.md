José María Gamarra (Teresita’s father in-law) contributed to the development of “Los Yungas” during the first half of the twentieth century.


Before the agrarian reform in 1953, the industrial agricultural society “José María Gamarra S.A”  became the most important agricultural company in Bolivia,owning 30 productive farms mostly in Nor Yungas.


The Industrial Agricultural Society contributed in many forms to the development of the country, for example in infrastructure they helped with the construction of many roads in Yungas, the construction of one hospital in Coripata and the construction of the Stadium “José María Gamarra” which years later was renamed to “Ramiro Castillo Stadium” in honor to a soccer player born in the town. In the agricultural field the contributions were also important. The society introduced first class quality bananas from Ecuador, named “Platano Guayaquil”, also they helped with the improvement of coffee plantations in the region.


But the society got relevancy being the first tax payer income in La Paz due the coca leave plantations taxes. In that time “coca leave” was designated to the traditional and medical use only.


The production of an excellent quality of coca leaves in his farms, gave Don José Maria the name of “The Coca King”.
