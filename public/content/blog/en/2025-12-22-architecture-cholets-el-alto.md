Have you ever heard of the term **"Cholet"**? These are the luxurious and extravagant residences rising in the city of El Alto, at 4,100 meters above sea level, overlooking La Paz.

## A Cultural Fusion: "Chalet" meets "Cholo"

The name is a blend of **"Chalet"** and **"Cholo"**. In Bolivia, "cholo" refers to mestizo people with strong Aymara roots. Once a pejorative term, it is now a badge of honor for a successful new bourgeoisie. Their concept is simple: *"If the elite live in chalets, we will live in cholets."*

## Freddy Mamani: The Mind Behind the Color

You cannot talk about Cholets without mentioning **Freddy Mamani Silvestre**. This Bolivian architect of Aymara origin, a former bricklayer turned engineer, is the primary creator and promoter of this style.

Inspired by traditional textiles and the ancient ruins of Tiwanaku, Mamani has transformed the city's skyline with vibrant colors and geometric shapes. His work is now globally recognized as a powerful expression of modern Andean identity.

## The Architecture of Success

Cholets usually follow a five-story structure designed for both business and prestige:

* **Ground Floor:** Commercial spaces.
* **Middle Floors:** Lavish ballrooms with neon lights and intricate decorations.
* **Top Floor:** The owner's private chalet, built on the rooftop with a terrace.

**The facade is the building's signature.** Using reflective glass and themes like Transformers or the Statue of Liberty, these buildings are designed to be seen. In El Alto, facades are about pride and status.

## Tips for Your Visit

* Take the **Red Line** to the *16 de Julio* station.
* Switch to the **Blue Line** towards *Plaza Libertad* and *Plaza La Paz*.
* **Pro Tip:** Visit on Thursday or Sunday to experience the massive "16 de Julio" street market.
