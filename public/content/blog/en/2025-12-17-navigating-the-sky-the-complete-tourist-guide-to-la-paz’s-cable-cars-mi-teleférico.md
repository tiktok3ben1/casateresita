**La Paz is a city that defies gravity.** While most capitals build subways underground, La Paz looked up. **Mi Teleférico** is not just a transport system; it is the main tourist attraction of the city and a feat of modern engineering.

If you are visiting La Paz, riding the cable car is non-negotiable. But with more than 10 lines and endless connections, it can be confusing. Here is everything you need to know to navigate the La Paz sky like a pro.

## Why is it Unique in the World?

At 4,000 meters above sea level, building a subway was impossible due to the underground rivers and topography. The solution? **The largest urban cable car network in the world.** It connects the center of La Paz (a bowl) with El Alto (the plateau), transforming a commute of 1 hour into 10 minutes.

## The 3 Best Lines for Tourists

Although all lines are useful, these three offer the most spectacular experiences for a visitor:

### 1. The Red Line (Línea Roja)

* **The Route:** From the Central Station (near the center) to El Alto (Zone 16 de Julio).
* **Why take it:** It offers the most drastic view of the change in altitude. You pass directly over the general cemetery, offering a unique cultural perspective.
* **The Highlight:** Arriving on Thursdays or Sundays directly at the famous **El Alto Flea Market** (Feria 16 de Julio).

### 2. The Yellow Line (Línea Amarilla)

* **The Route:** From Sopocachi to Ciudad Satélite.
* **Why take it:** It is widely considered the most scenic line. The slope is steep, and as you ascend, the snowy **Illimani Mountain** reveals itself in all its glory.
* **Best Time:** At sunset (approx. 6:00 PM) to watch the city lights turn on.

### 3. The Silver Line (Línea Plateada)

* **The Route:** Connects the Yellow, Red, and Purple lines along the edge of El Alto.
* **Why take it:** It offers a panoramic view of the entire La Paz "bowl" from above. It is perfect for photography lovers.


## Practical Guide: Prices and How to Use It

Using the cable car is safe, clean, and incredibly cheap.

* **Single Ticket Cost:** 3 Bolivianos (approx. $0.5 USD).
* **Smart Card:** If you plan to take several lines, buy a rechargeable card at any ticket office (Cost: 30 BOB with credit included). It saves you time in queues.
* **Transfers:** If you change lines, you have to pay again unless you have the card (which offers a discount on transfers).

## Safety and Altitude Tips

The system is extremely safe and runs on renewable electricity. However, remember that the upper stations in El Alto are at **4,100 meters**.

* **Take it easy:** Walking at the stations in El Alto can leave you breathless.
* **Warm clothes:** Even if it's sunny in the center, it is windy and cold up there. Bring a jacket.

## Beyond the View: A Social Revolution

As you fly over the roofs, notice the murals and street art. The cable car has democratized the city, connecting social classes and neighborhoods that were previously isolated. It is a symbol of the new Bolivia.
